In this work, a set of large-scale measurements were made on a collection of 500, 000 twitter accounts. Differences were observed in terms of tweet behavior, content, and properties. After measurements were the classification system proposed was based on 4 components. Components in machine learning, entry, account properties, and decisions were used. Experimentation was done to evaluate the accuracy of their system.

In this work, the methods used by three teams in the DARPA challenge are described. They concluded that bot detection required a prescribed workflow. The flow begins with initial bot detection which consisted of finding patters in heuristics, linguistics, behaviors, and inconsistencies. Once they were found outliers, and clustered were searched for. This initial classification of bots could then be used to identify new bots using standard classification classifiers.
