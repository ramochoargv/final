## Literature Review and Related Works

In our study we were able to find great articles in related works to guide our decision making. The following articles being noteworthy. 


# 1. "Who is tweeting on Twitter: human, bot, or cyborg?"


In this work, a set of large-scale measurements were made on a collection of 500, 000 twitter accounts. Differences were observed in terms of tweet behavior, content, and properties. After measurements were the classification system proposed was based on 4 components. Components in machine learning, entry, account properties, and decisions were used. Experimentation was done to evaluate the accuracy of their system.

# 2. "The DARPA twitter bot challenge"


>In this work, the methods used by three teams in the DARPA challenge are described. They concluded that bot detection >required a prescribed workflow. The flow begins with initial bot detection which consisted of finding patters in heuristics, >linguistics, behaviors, and inconsistencies. Once they were found outliers, and clustered were searched for. This initial >classification of bots could then be used to identify new bots using standard classification classifiers.

# 3. "A new approach to bot detection: striking the balance between precision and recall"


In this work, it is stated that current bot detection systems focus on precision at the cost of recall. Precision is defined as the positive predictive value and recall is defined as the sensitivity, meaning the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified. They claim is that this means their detection system improved the number of bots actually deleted versus just detected.

# 4. "A comparison of different methods for modelling rare events data"

This work examines different methods for modeling rare events data using binomial linear regression. It discusses potential remedies such as under sampling, over sampling, penalties, and skewed link functions.
