## 1. Summary

--let me know if you disagree with this. I'm all for changing it if you had better results

Overall, when we predicted using our models, they did predict bots. However, we are not confident in their accuracy due to the problem of rare successes in this data. The "dumb" model of always classifying as human has better results (97.3%) than our best model (%).

For the bots in our data set, we found average sentiment for the bot topics was -.002, whereas humans averaged .099. Is this difference actually statistically significant? Probably not. The standard deviations are approx .26, .3 respectively.
